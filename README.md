Chinese study app

About
  Pet project to understand app development
  On the backburner until I get the itch
  The goal is to transfer all my flashcards from boxes to my phone
  Two sections: memorize characters and memorize terms (6 boxes, 3 per section)
  Characters will have most common terms on the backside with the 'true' meaning of the character
  Terms just have characters and pinyin on one side and english on the other, single tap to see other side and swipe to agree
